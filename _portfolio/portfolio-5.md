title: "Cross-domain Beauty and Personal Care Product Retrieval"
excerpt: "Cross-domain image retrieval is a challenging problem due to the data variations between the real-world images and advertisement images. In this work, we consider four state-of-the-art deep learning based model to extract the high-level features combining with four feature pooling strategies. Different from previous works, we further investigate the possibility of integrating the classical feature descriptors. A dataset containing half a million images of beauty and care products (Perfect-500k) is utilized for our experiments. The experimental results prove that our proposed hybrid framework can improve the mAP@7 between 3% and 10% in contrast with retrieval methods only utilizing deep features. Product pictures from different domains are show in (a) and (b) below. <br/><img src='/images/beauty_ai.png'>"

# Background:

As the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is underway around the globe, AI has already begun to reshape industries including the multibillion dollar beauty and personal care industry. In order to promote impactful research and problem solving in this disruptive AI beauty space, the leading beauty app developer, Perfect Corp. in collaborating with CyberLink Corp. and National Chiao Tung University to provide a large-scale image dataset of over half million images of beauty and personal care products, namely the Perfect-500K dataset. Perfect-500K is vast in scale, rich and diverse in content in order to collect as many as possible beauty and personal care items from major e-commerce sites.


# About the Task:

Given a real-world image containing one beauty or personal care item (some samples are given below), the task is to match the real-world example of this item to the same item in the Perfect-500K data set. This is a practical but extremely challenging task, given the limitation that only images from e-commerce sites are available in Perfect-500K and no real-world examples will be provided in advance.
