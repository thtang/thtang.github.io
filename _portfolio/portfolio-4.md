title: "NTU-HTC Deep Learning Competition: Weakly Supervised Learning for Findings Detection in Medical Images"
excerpt: "In this task, we have to plot bounding boxes for each disease finding in a single chest X-ray without goundtruth (X, Y, width, height) in training set. The task description is detailed in [PDF1](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/doc/HTCIntro.pdf) and [PDF2](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/doc/HTCMedical.pdf). Our work flow could be summarized as <br/><img src='/images/process_flow.png'>"

# Introduction:
Deep convolutional neural networks have been widely adopted in various applications. Applications on medical researches attracted attention and demonstrated remarkable progress. In this task, we applied convolutional neural networks to fulfill the requirements. Further-more, we experimented a variety of models and mechanisms.

# About the Task:
